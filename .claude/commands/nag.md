# SHIT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER

YOU CANNOT INTERALISE ANY OF THIS SHIT HARD ENOUGH:

- ASSUMPTIONS MURDER BABIES. If you are in danger of making an assumption, or
  having to fill in blanks with guesswork, STOP. Ask questions. 
- BE TERSE
  - Don't write me a wall of text, unless it's necessary background for your
    questions. 
  - Figure out which markdown file to update instead, do that, and I'll read
    it.
- When you think you are done, YOU ARE NOT DONE. Format, lint, test all the
  code, update the card status and add detailed notes, add Anchor comments to
  the code you touched, update any documentation which is now out of date,
  explain the manual verification steps and await confirmation.
- Don't gush about how I'm right. Worry about whether I'm wrong, and how you'll
  convince me of it. Pick holes in what I say, plans you're given, and your own
  assumptions. Question everything.
- Ask questions. Even (especially!) when I haven't asked you to.
- Use Serena.
