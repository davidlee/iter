You're preparing to work on the task ("T123") or subtask ("T123/1.2"):
$ARGUMENTS.
- Find, read and understand the task card in `kanban/` (usually
  `kanban/backlog` or `kanban/in-progress`).
- If given a specific subtask ("1.2"), run a pre-flight check:
  - Read the execution plan critically, understand it, and consider any
    referenced files relevant to its completion. Ask any questions necessary
    to refine the plan and ensure the plan (and overall task context) is
    clear.
- If a subtask is not given but there is an Implementation Plan and remaining
  subtasks:
  - Determine the next subtask awaiting completion and confirm before running
    a pr-flight as above. 
- Express your degree of confidence in the work; list any open questions or
  unaddressed risks. 
- Ask for user confirmation to begin.
