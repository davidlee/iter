Time for a git commit.
- Ensure you've run the formatter (if any).
- Ensure ALL tests pass.
- Ensure any linters in use are run on ALL files and there are no errors or
  warnings.
- Add all modified and new files to git. 
  - If you think there are files that should not be in version control, stop and ask the user.  
  - If you see files that you think should be grouped into separate cohesive commits, do that.
- Use clear and concise one-line commit messages, following project conventions. 
  commit notation. 
  - If you think a particular commit really deserves a terse summary below that, ask the user. But you should probably be committing more often.
- The user is EXPLICITLY asking you to commit.
- Don't push or pull without explicit instruction.
