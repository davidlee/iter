Your context window won't last forever.
Think about what you've learnt during your recent activities. 
Add the best guidance you can to help another agent pick up your work.

In the task card for the (sub)task you've been working on:
- Add detailed Notes
- Expand or modify the Implementation Plan where appropriate. Ask if unsure.
- Add references to significant code files & docs to the list. 
- Suggest any future improvements or refactoring advisable.
- Ensure tracked progress is accurate and up to date.

In other recently modified files (code, docs):
- Add (or modify) Anchor comments
- Update links to related files wherever appropriate.
- If your understanding has obsoleted documentation, update it:
  - `doc/specifications` should always reflect the best detailed design available to guide implementation.
  - `doc/decisions/` a revised decision is a new ADR.
  - `doc/design-artefacts` should be updated while the task is being worked on, but not after.

Then, commit.
