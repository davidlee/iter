# T021: Entries File Resilience Improvements

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: Done  
**Related tasks**: ["related:T020"]

## 1. Habit

Improve data resilience for entries.yml file operations through automatic backups, validation, and comprehensive documentation of storage patterns.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document current entries.yml file operations and marshalling patterns 
- [x] Add anchor comments throughout storage layer for consistency
- [x] Create specification document for entries.yml format and operations
- [x] Implement automatic backup creation before modifications
- [x] Add marshalled data validation before atomic writes
- [x] Make backup behavior configurable (stub config system)
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility and atomic write guarantees

## 3. Implementation Plan & Progress

### Current Analysis
- Storage uses atomic writes (temp file + rename) âœ…
- Full file rewrite on each save (load-modify-save pattern)
- BackupFile() method exists but not auto-called
- Single .backup file, no versioning
- No validation of marshalled data before write

### Sub-tasks
- [x] 1.1: Document current entries.yml operations and add anchor comments
- [x] 1.2: Create doc/specifications/entries_storage.md specification
- [x] 1.3: Implement automatic backup with configurable behavior
- [x] 1.4: Add marshalled data validation before writes
- [x] 1.5: Test resilience improvements with various failure scenarios

## 4. Roadblocks

None identified.

## 5. Notes / Discussion Log

### Implementation Completed

**Key Files Modified:**
- `internal/storage/entries.go` - Core storage implementation with resilience improvements
- `doc/specifications/entries_storage.md` - Complete specification document (NEW)

**Features Implemented:**

1. **Automatic Backup System** (lines 150-166 in entries.go)
   - `SaveToFileWithBackup()` method with configurable behavior
   - `BackupConfig` struct for future user configuration
   - `DefaultBackupConfig()` with safe defaults (enabled by default)
   - Integrated into `UpdateDayEntry()` and `AddDayEntry()` methods

2. **Marshal Validation** (lines 98-103 in entries.go)
   - Round-trip validation before atomic writes
   - Prevents corrupted YAML from being written to disk
   - Maintains existing atomic write guarantees

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Added anchor comments throughout storage layer (search "T021")
   - Complete specification document covering file format, operations, resilience
   - Performance characteristics and error handling documented

**Testing Verified:**
- Automatic backup creation on second save (not first)
- Backup contains previous file content correctly
- Marshal validation rejects invalid data
- Original file unchanged when validation fails
- All existing storage tests pass

**Configuration Design:**
```go
type BackupConfig struct {
    Enabled           bool  // Enable/disable automatic backups
    CreateBeforeWrite bool  // Backup before each write operation  
}
```

### Future Improvements Recommended

1. **Enhanced Configuration System**
   - Move BackupConfig to dedicated config package
   - Add user settings file (~/.config/vice/config.yml)
   - Support backup retention policies (multiple versioned backups)
   - Configurable backup directory location

2. **Backup Versioning**
   - Timestamp-based backup filenames (entries.yml.2025-07-14-15-30-45.backup)
   - Automatic cleanup of old backups (configurable retention count)
   - Backup compression for space efficiency

3. **Error Recovery Tools**
   - CLI command to list available backups
   - Restore command to revert from backup
   - Integrity check command for corruption detection

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Incremental backup (only changed data)
   - Async backup operations for large files
   - Backup only on significant changes (not every habit entry)

### Architecture Notes

- **Pattern**: All write operations use load-modify-save with full file rewrite
- **Safety**: Atomic writes (temp file + rename) prevent partial corruption
- **Validation**: Strict YAML parsing + schema validation + marshal round-trip
- **Backup Strategy**: Simple .backup suffix, single file (configurable)
- **Performance**: ~100KB typical file size, negligible impact

### Related Work

- Builds on T020 human-readable YAML time storage improvements
- Custom YAML marshaling provides backward compatibility
- Storage layer anchor comments follow established patterns
- Specification document follows doc/specifications/habit_schema.md format
