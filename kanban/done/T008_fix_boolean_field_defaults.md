# Fix Boolean Field Defaults in Entry Form

## 1. Goal / User Story

When using `iter entry` to record habit data, form controls should default to previously written data to minimize friction during daily entry. Currently, boolean fields incorrectly default to "No" even when previous data shows "Yes", while numeric fields correctly preserve previous values.

This bug reduces user experience by forcing re-entry of unchanged boolean values and breaks the principle of low-friction entry.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Boolean form fields default to previously saved values when editing existing entries
- [ ] Numeric fields continue to work correctly (already functioning)
- [ ] Notes field behavior remains unchanged (defaulting to skip is correct)
- [ ] Form submission preserves all field types correctly
- [ ] No regression in form functionality

## 3. Implementation Plan & Progress

**Overall Status:** `Completed`

**Sub-tasks:**

- [x] **Investigation Phase**: Identify root cause of boolean default behavior
  - [x] **Sub-task 1.1:** Examine entry form UI code
    - *Design:* Locate form initialization and field default logic
    - *Code/Artifacts to be examined:* `cmd/entry.go`, UI form components
    - *Testing Strategy:* Manual testing with existing entry data
    - *AI Notes:* Found issue in `simple_handler.go:62` - boolean variable not initialized with existing value
  - [x] **Sub-task 1.2:** Trace data flow from storage to form fields
    - *Design:* Follow data path from file storage through to UI display
    - *Code/Artifacts to be examined:* Storage layer, form population logic
    - *Testing Strategy:* Add debug logging to trace data flow
    - *AI Notes:* Data flow works correctly - issue was in form field initialization

- [x] **Fix Implementation**: Correct boolean field default behavior
  - [x] **Sub-task 2.1:** Implement proper boolean field defaulting
    - *Design:* Initialize `completed` variable with `currentValue` before passing to huh.Confirm
    - *Code/Artifacts to be modified:* `internal/ui/simple_handler.go:62`
    - *Testing Strategy:* Unit tests for form population, manual testing with various boolean states
    - *AI Notes:* Simple one-line fix: `completed := currentValue` instead of `var completed bool`

## 4. Roadblocks

*(None currently identified)*

## 5. Notes / Discussion Log

- `2025-07-12 - User:` Reported that boolean fields default to "No" even when previous data is "Yes"
- `2025-07-12 - User:` Numeric data appears to work correctly, notes behavior (defaulting to skip) is intentional
- `2025-07-12 - AI:` Root cause identified: huh.Confirm field requires boolean variable to be pre-initialized with existing value
- `2025-07-12 - AI:` Fix implemented by changing `var completed bool` to `completed := currentValue` in simple_handler.go:62
- `2025-07-12 - AI:` Changes committed as fab7543

## 6. Code Snippets & Artifacts

**Fix applied in `internal/ui/simple_handler.go:62`:**

```go
// Before:
var completed bool

// After: 
completed := currentValue  // Initialize with existing boolean value
```

This ensures the huh.Confirm field defaults to the previously saved boolean value when editing existing entries.
