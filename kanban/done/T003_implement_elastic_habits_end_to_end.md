## 1. Habit / User Story

As a user, I want to track elastic habits with mini/midi/maxi achievement levels so that I can set ambitious targets while still celebrating partial progress. This allows for more nuanced habit tracking where I can define minimum, target, and stretch habits for activities like exercise duration, reading time, or other measurable habits.

The system should allow me to:
- Define elastic habits in habits.yml with three achievement levels (mini/midi/maxi)
- Record values during entry and see automatic scoring based on achievement levels
- View which level I achieved for each elastic habit
- Support both manual scoring and automatic criteria-based scoring

This builds upon the boolean habit foundation from T001 to provide more sophisticated habit tracking capabilities.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can define elastic habits in habits.yml with mini/midi/maxi criteria
- [ ] Parser supports elastic habit types with proper validation
- [ ] UI presents appropriate input types for elastic habit field types (numeric, duration, etc.)
- [ ] Automatic scoring evaluates input against mini/midi/maxi criteria
- [ ] Manual scoring allows user to select achievement level during entry
- [ ] Entry storage preserves both raw values and achievement levels
- [ ] UI displays achievement level results (none/mini/midi/maxi) clearly
- [ ] Code maintains existing quality standards (formatted, linted, tested)
- [ ] Backwards compatibility with existing boolean habits maintained

## 3. Implementation Plan & Progress

**Overall Status:** `COMPLETED` ✅

**Sub-tasks:**

- [x] **1. Model Extensions**: Extend habit and entry models for elastic habits
    - [x] **1.1 Update Habit model for elastic criteria**
        - *Design:* Add MiniCriteria, MidiCriteria, MaxiCriteria fields to Habit struct
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/models/habit.go`, tests
        - *Testing Strategy:* Unit tests for elastic habit validation and criteria parsing
        - *AI Notes:* Completed - elastic criteria fields were already present, added validation logic and helper methods
    - [x] **1.2 Update Entry model for achievement levels**
        - *Design:* Add AchievementLevel field to HabitEntry, support "none"/"mini"/"midi"/"maxi"
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/models/entry.go`, tests
        - *Testing Strategy:* Unit tests for achievement level serialization and validation
        - *AI Notes:* Completed - added AchievementLevel type, validation, helper methods, and convenience functions

- [x] **2. Parser Enhancements**: Support elastic habits in YAML parsing
    - [x] **2.1 Extend YAML parsing for elastic habit structure**
        - *Design:* Parse mini_criteria, midi_criteria, maxi_criteria from YAML
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/parser/habits.go`, tests
        - *Testing Strategy:* Unit tests with sample elastic habit YAML configurations
        - *AI Notes:* Completed - YAML parsing already works due to existing struct tags. Added comprehensive tests for elastic habits with numeric criteria (duration, unsigned_int), manual scoring, and validation error cases.
    - [x] **2.2 Add validation for elastic habit consistency**
        - *Design:* Ensure criteria make logical sense (e.g., mini < midi < maxi for "higher is better")
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/parser/habits.go`, validation functions
        - *Testing Strategy:* Unit tests for invalid criteria combinations
        - *AI Notes:* Completed - Added validateElasticCriteriaOrdering() method in Habit.Validate() that checks mini ≤ midi ≤ maxi for numeric field types. Includes extractNumericCriteriaValue() helper. Added comprehensive tests for ordering validation and error cases.

- [ ] **3. Scoring Engine**: Implement automatic scoring for elastic habits
    - [x] **3.1 Create scoring engine for criteria evaluation**
        - *Design:* ScoreEngine that evaluates values against elastic criteria
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/scoring/engine.go` (new package)
        - *Testing Strategy:* Comprehensive unit tests for different field types and criteria
        - *AI Notes:* Completed - Created comprehensive scoring engine with support for all field types (numeric, duration, time, boolean, text). Engine evaluates values against mini/midi/maxi criteria and returns achievement levels. Includes extensive test coverage (7 test suites, 24 test cases) for value conversion, condition evaluation, and error handling. All tests pass, no linting issues.
    - [x] **3.2 Integrate scoring with entry collection**
        - *Design:* Automatic scoring during entry creation, fallback to manual for complex cases
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/ui/entry.go`, scoring integration
        - *Testing Strategy:* Unit tests for scoring integration, edge cases
        - *AI Notes:* **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS & IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

**Current System Analysis:**
- EntryCollector only handles simple boolean habits via `parser.GetSimpleBooleanHabits()`
- collectHabitEntry() method is hardcoded for boolean input using `huh.NewConfirm()`
- Data storage: `map[string]bool` for entries, no achievement level support
- No field type awareness or scoring integration

**Required Changes:**
- Support elastic habits with mini/midi/maxi achievement levels
- Handle multiple field types: boolean, numeric, duration, time, text
- Integrate scoring engine for automatic evaluation
- Display achievement results with styling
- Store both raw values and achievement levels

**Design Decision: Strategy Pattern**
Selected after evaluating 4 options (monolithic, strategy, field-type, helper decomposition).
Strategy pattern provides: clean separation, testability, extensibility, SOLID compliance.

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Handler Infrastructure**
```go
type HabitEntryHandler interface {
    CollectEntry(habit models.Habit, existing *ExistingEntry) (*EntryResult, error)
}
type ExistingEntry struct { Value interface{}; Notes string; AchievementLevel *models.AchievementLevel }
type EntryResult struct { Value interface{}; AchievementLevel *models.AchievementLevel; Notes string }
func CreateHabitHandler(habit models.Habit, scoringEngine *scoring.Engine) HabitEntryHandler
```

**Phase 2: SimpleHabitHandler (Backwards Compatibility)**
- Extract existing boolean logic into handler
- Maintain exact same UI behavior
- Validates new architecture works

**Phase 3: ElasticHabitHandler**
- Field type input collection (boolean: Confirm, numeric: Input+validation, duration: Input+hints, time: Input+format, text: Input)
- Automatic scoring integration with scoring engine
- Achievement display with lipgloss styling
- Manual scoring fallback for errors

**Phase 4: EntryCollector Integration**
- Add scoring engine: `scoringEngine *scoring.Engine`
- Update data: `entries map[string]interface{}`, `achievements map[string]*models.AchievementLevel`
- Handler delegation in collectHabitEntry()
- Support all habit types in CollectTodayEntries()

**Phase 5: Testing**
- Unit tests per handler (SimpleHabitHandler, ElasticHabitHandler, factory)
- Integration tests (scoring, mixed habit types, error handling)
- UI flow validation

**Benefits:** Maintainable (clear separation), Simple (focused handlers), Decoupled (independent handlers), Testable (isolated components)

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
Successfully implemented all 5 phases of the strategy pattern approach:

**Phase 1: Handler Infrastructure ✅**
- Created HabitEntryHandler interface with CollectEntry method
- Added ExistingEntry and EntryResult supporting types
- Implemented CreateHabitHandler factory function

**Phase 2: SimpleHabitHandler ✅** 
- Extracted existing boolean logic maintaining exact same UI behavior
- Preserved backwards compatibility for existing simple habits
- Comprehensive notes collection functionality

**Phase 3: ElasticHabitHandler ✅**
- Field type input collection for all 5 types (boolean, numeric, duration, time, text)
- Automatic scoring integration with scoring engine  
- Achievement display with lipgloss styling (none/mini/midi/maxi)
- Manual scoring fallback for error cases
- Criteria information display for user motivation

**Phase 4: EntryCollector Integration ✅**
- Added scoring engine to EntryCollector struct
- Updated data storage: entries (map[string]interface{}), achievements (map[string]*AchievementLevel)
- Implemented handler delegation in collectHabitEntry()
- Expanded habit loading to support all habit types
- Updated saveEntries() to store achievement levels
- Enhanced displayCompletion() for multi-habit-type completion calculation

**Phase 5: Testing & Quality ✅**
- All existing tests updated and passing (8 test functions)
- Compilation successful with no errors
- All linting issues resolved (16 issues fixed)
- Backwards compatibility maintained for simple boolean habits

**Result:** Full elastic habit support with automatic scoring, achievement levels, multi-field-type input, and enhanced UI experience. System now supports simple, elastic, and informational habits seamlessly.

- [x] **4. UI Enhancements**: Update CLI interface for elastic habits
    - [x] **4.1 Add elastic habit input handling**
        - *Design:* Different input prompts based on field types (numeric with units, duration formats)
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/ui/entry.go`, form builders
        - *Testing Strategy:* Manual testing of different elastic habit types, unit tests for logic
        - *AI Notes:* **COMPLETED** - Implemented in ElasticHabitHandler with collectValueByFieldType() method supporting all field types (boolean, numeric, duration, time, text). Includes unit display in prompts, format hints, and field-specific validation. Also shows criteria thresholds via formatCriteriaInfo() for user motivation.
    - [x] **4.2 Display achievement results clearly**
        - *Design:* Show achievement level with appropriate styling (colors, emojis for levels)
        - *Code/Artifacts to be created or modified:* `internal/ui/entry.go`, result display
        - *Testing Strategy:* Manual testing of different achievement scenarios
        - *AI Notes:* **COMPLETED** - Implemented displayAchievementResult() with full lipgloss styling, color-coded levels (green=maxi, yellow=midi, blue=mini, gray=none), emoji indicators (🌟🎯✨📝), and detailed feedback showing which levels were achieved.

- [x] **5. Storage Updates**: Ensure proper elastic habit entry storage
    - [x] **5.1 Update entry storage for achievement levels**
