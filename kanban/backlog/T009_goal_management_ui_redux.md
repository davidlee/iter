## Notes (temp)

Follows on from T005.

We have implemented informational goals with Boolean, Text, Time, Duration field types. 
We have Simple+Manual+Boolean goals. We don't yet have Simple+Manual+(other field types). 
We don't yet have working Elastic goals.

simple > automatic
  Ôê≤ iter goal add --dry-run

  üéØ Add New Goal

  Let's create a new goal through guided prompts.

  ‚úÖ Goal created successfully: test
  Error: goal validation failed: criteria is required for automatic scoring

elastic > automatic
  Ôê≤ iter goal add --dry-run

  üéØ Add New Goal

  Let's create a new goal through guided prompts.

  ‚úÖ Goal created successfully: test
  Error: goal validation failed: mini_criteria is required for automatic scoring of elastic goals

elastic > manual

    - title: test
      id: test
      position: 7
      goal_type: elastic
      field_type:
        type: boolean
      scoring_type: manual
      prompt: Did you accomplish this goal today?
(no errors, but not correct; an elastic manual goal should be able to have a text/time/duration/(checklist) field for information capture; a boolean field is nonsensical here although maybe (maybe ) makes sense as a convention that there's no other field type.

Not sure how much of this is not implemented vs currently broken - that's the first thing to determine.

---
musings:

Actually that's a requirement worth highlighting that's slipped through the cracks a bit:
- simple+manual goals should be able to have a non-boolean field type, even if they lack criteria (which automatically scored goals have)
- the current design conflates a boolean data field with the (boolean or quaternary) success / failure scoring of a goal or habit.
  - a boolean checkbox + comment text might be data manually reviewed to make a pass/fail determination.
  - or, that might be an edge case, and we should just remove boolean "fields". We have checklists, after all.
  - haven't yet tackled the design issues of allowing multiple fields for a goal, potentially of different kinds - nor evaluated the benefits.
- the more I think about it the less apt "goal" seems and the more it should be called "habit" or "routine" or ...

## 1. Goal / User Story

As a user, I want to create and configure all goal types with appropriate field types and scoring mechanisms so that I can track diverse habits and routines with the data collection and scoring approach that best fits each one.

**Current State (from T005):**
- ‚úÖ Simple + Manual + Boolean goals work correctly
- ‚úÖ Informational goals with all field types (Boolean, Text, Numeric, Time, Duration) work correctly
- ‚úÖ ChecklistGoal support added to goal configuration UI (T007/4.1)
- ‚ùå Simple + Automatic goals fail validation ("criteria is required")
- ‚ùå Elastic goals incomplete/broken (missing criteria, inappropriate field types)
- ‚ùå Simple + Manual goals limited to Boolean fields only

**User Story:**
I want to create goals that match my tracking needs:
- **Simple + Manual + Non-Boolean**: Track completion with additional data (e.g., "Did I exercise?" + duration field)
- **Simple + Automatic**: Goals with clear numeric/time criteria (e.g., "Exercise for 30+ minutes")
- **Elastic + Manual**: Three-tier achievement goals with subjective scoring (e.g., "mini/midi/maxi exercise intensity")
- **Elastic + Automatic**: Three-tier goals with numeric criteria (e.g., "mini: 15min, midi: 30min, maxi: 60min exercise")
- **All goal types**: Should support appropriate field types for data collection beyond simple Boolean completion

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

## 4. Roadblocks

*(Timestamped list of any impediments. AI adds here when a sub-task is marked `[blocked]`)*

## 5. Notes / Discussion Log

**2025-07-12 - AI Initial Analysis:**
- T005 provides excellent foundation with working SimpleGoalCreator and InformationalGoalCreator
- Key issue: Current Simple goals hardcoded to Boolean fields, missing field type selection
- ElasticGoal completely missing but models/validation support exists
- Automatic scoring criteria definition missing for Simple goals
- ChecklistGoal support added in T007/4.1 provides additional reference implementation
- Strategy: Extend existing creators rather than rewrite, maintain idiomatic bubbletea patterns

**2025-07-12 - Design Decisions (T009/1.1):**
1. **Field Type Support**: Simple goals support all field types except checklist (Boolean, Text, Numeric, Time, Duration)
2. **Text Field Restriction**: Text fields restricted to manual scoring only (no automatic text-based criteria)
3. **UI Flow Pattern**: Use multi-step forms (like InformationalGoalCreator) with step omission when not required
4. **Quick Path**: Boolean+Manual remains the streamlined path with minimal steps
5. **Comment Pattern**: Optional comment field accompanies all field types, extend to checklist fields also

**Simple Goal Field Type Matrix (Approved):**
| Field Type | Manual Scoring | Automatic Scoring | Criteria Options | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Boolean | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | `equals: true` | Traditional pass/fail + quick path |
| Text | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Subjective content, manual only |
| Numeric | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `range` | Exercise minutes, reps, etc. |
| Time | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | `before`, `after` | Wake-up time, bedtime |
| Duration | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `range` | Exercise duration, meditation |
| Checklist | ‚ùå N/A | ‚ùå N/A | N/A | Use ChecklistGoal type instead |

**Enhanced SimpleGoalCreator Flow Design:**
1. **Boolean + Manual (Quick Path)**: Basic Info ‚Üí Scoring Type (auto-select manual) ‚Üí Prompt ‚Üí Save (2 steps)
2. **Boolean + Automatic**: Basic Info ‚Üí Scoring Type ‚Üí Criteria (equals: true) ‚Üí Save (3 steps)
3. **Other Field Types + Manual**: Basic Info ‚Üí Field Type ‚Üí Field Config ‚Üí Scoring Type ‚Üí Comment/Prompt ‚Üí Save (4-5 steps)
4. **Other Field Types + Automatic**: Basic Info ‚Üí Field Type ‚Üí Field Config ‚Üí Scoring Type ‚Üí Criteria ‚Üí Comment/Prompt ‚Üí Save (5-6 steps)

**Step Omission Strategy:**
- Skip Field Type step for Boolean goals (maintain current quick path)
- Skip Field Config step when field type needs no configuration
- Skip Criteria step for manual scoring
- Skip Comment step if user doesn't want additional data collection

**Design Considerations:**
- **Field Type Appropriateness**: All field types except checklist supported for Simple goals
- **Automatic vs Manual Scoring**: 
  - Manual: User decides achievement level, field data is informational
  - Automatic: System determines achievement based on field data meeting criteria
- **Text Field Limitation**: Text fields restricted to manual scoring (no automatic text evaluation)
- **Comment Pattern**: Optional comment field for all field types including checklist goals (ChecklistGoalCreator needs enhancement)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Boolean+Manual flow preserved as quick path

**T009/1.2 Implementation Details (2025-07-12):**
- **Multi-step Conversion**: Converted SimpleGoalCreator from sequential groups to multi-step forms

- **Scoring Restrictions**: Text fields restricted to manual scoring only (automatic scoring prevented)
- **Comment Integration**: Optional comment field appended to goal description (temporary solution)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 9 unit tests covering all field types and flow scenarios

- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for elastic goal creation failures with clear error propagation
- **UI Consistency**: ElasticGoal option already properly configured in goal type selection with clear description

- **Headless Testing Ready**: `TestElasticGoalData` struct and `NewElasticGoalCreatorForTesting()` constructor
- **Validation Strategy**: Real-time validation for criteria ordering and proper threshold definitions
- **Reuse Patterns**: Field configuration, scoring selection, and form patterns from SimpleGoalCreator
- **Goal Building**: Complete three-tier criteria construction with models.MiniCriteria/MidiCriteria/MaxiCriteria

**Technical Integration Points (T009/1.1 Findings):**
- **Existing FieldValueInput System**: Ready for reuse in criteria definition (field_value_input.go)
- **InformationalGoalCreator Patterns**: Multi-step approach with `currentStep` and `initializeStep()` method
- **ChecklistGoalCreator Patterns**: Sequential form groups in single huh.Form (simpler but less flexible)
- **Models Support**: Complete criteria condition support for all field types in models.Condition struct
