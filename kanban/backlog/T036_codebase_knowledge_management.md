# Codebase Knowledge Management & Documentation Review

**Context (Background)**:
Comprehensive review and enhancement of codebase knowledge management systems. Extract valuable insights from completed task cards, ensure proper documentation linkage through anchor comments, and maintain a well-organized knowledge base for future development.

**Type**: `maintenance`

**Overall Status:** `Backlog`

## Reference (Relevant Files / URLs)

### Significant Code (Files / Functions)
**Documentation Sources:**
- `kanban/done/` - Completed task cards with valuable insights
- `kanban/in-progress/` - Current task cards with implementation notes
- `doc/decisions/` - ADR collection needing expansion
- `doc/design-artefacts/` - Design documents to review and extract from
- `internal/**/*.go` - Code files needing anchor comments linking to ADRs/specs

**Knowledge Management Patterns:**
- AIDEV-NOTE comments for AI/developer guidance
- ADR cross-references in implementation
- Design document extraction from task cards
- Future improvement tracking

### Related Tasks / History
- Extracted from T027 Phase 2.3.1 (anchor comments)
- Applies to all completed and in-progress tasks
- Supports ongoing knowledge management across the project

## Habit / User Story

As a developer (human or AI) working on the vice codebase, I need comprehensive knowledge management so that:
- Implementation decisions and rationale are discoverable through anchor comments
- Valuable insights from completed work are preserved and accessible
- ADRs capture significant decisions that span multiple tasks
- Design patterns and architectural insights are documented
- Future improvements are tracked and prioritized appropriately
- Code and documentation are properly cross-referenced

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

### Documentation Review & Extraction
- [ ] Review all completed task cards for ADR extraction opportunities

- [ ] Add context for future developers on non-obvious design choices

### Knowledge Base Organization
- [ ] Organize design artefacts and extract reusable patterns

- [ ] Standardize documentation patterns across the codebase
- [ ] Ensure consistency in ADR and design document formats

### Future Improvements Management
- [ ] Extract future improvement notes from completed task cards
- [ ] Create properly scoped backlog items for significant improvements
- [ ] Prioritize and organize improvement opportunities
- [ ] Link improvements to their originating context and rationale

## Implementation Plan & Progress

**Sub-tasks:**
*(Sub-task status: `[ ]` = todo, `[WIP]` = currently being worked on by AI , `[x]` = done, `[blocked]` = blocked)*

### 1. Documentation Audit & Review
- [ ] **1.1 Completed Task Card Review**: Audit all done/ and in-progress/ task cards
  - *Scope:* Review implementation notes, discussions, and insights from completed work
  - *Goals:* Identify ADR opportunities, design patterns, and valuable insights
  - *Deliverable:* Audit report with extraction recommendations
- [ ] **1.2 ADR Gap Analysis**: Identify decisions that should be documented as ADRs
  - *Scope:* Cross-cutting decisions, architectural patterns, technology choices
  - *Examples:* Repository Pattern adoption, YAML schema patterns, testing strategies
  - *Deliverable:* List of ADRs to create with priority and scope
- [ ] **1.3 Design Artefact Extraction**: Extract reusable design documents from task notes
  - *Scope:* Architecture diagrams, data models, integration patterns
  - *Examples:* Extract patterns from T027 flotsam implementation, T028 repository patterns
  - *Deliverable:* Organized design artefacts in doc/design-artefacts/

### 2. Anchor Comment Implementation
- [ ] **2.1 Code-to-Documentation Mapping**: Map code sections to relevant ADRs and specs
  - *Scope:* Identify key code sections that implement ADR decisions
  - *Pattern:* `// AIDEV-NOTE: implements ADR-XXX decision name`
  - *Examples:* Repository Pattern, YAML persistence, atomic operations
- [ ] **2.2 Complex Code Guidance**: Add guidance comments for complex implementations
  - *Scope:* Non-obvious algorithms, performance considerations, integration patterns
  - *Pattern:* `// AIDEV-NOTE: why-analysis; performance-hot-path; integration-boundary`
  - *Examples:* ZK compatibility layers, SRS algorithms, atomic file operations
- [ ] **2.3 Architecture Decision Linkage**: Connect implementation to architectural rationale
  - *Scope:* Link code to design decisions and trade-off analysis
  - *Pattern:* `// AIDEV-NOTE: see ADR-XXX for trade-off analysis`
  - *Examples:* Files-first vs database-first decisions, ZK compatibility choices

### 3. Knowledge Base Enhancement
- [ ] **3.1 Create Missing ADRs**: Document significant decisions discovered in review
  - *Scope:* Repository Pattern adoption, YAML schema standardization, testing patterns
  - *Format:* Follow ADR-template.md format consistently
  - *Cross-reference:* Link to originating task cards and implementation
- [ ] **3.2 Design Pattern Documentation**: Create reusable design pattern documentation
  - *Scope:* Common patterns used across the codebase
  - *Examples:* YAML persistence patterns, atomic file operations, validation patterns
  - *Location:* doc/design-patterns/ or integrate into existing specifications
- [ ] **3.3 Knowledge Discovery Index**: Create cross-reference system for easier navigation
  - *Scope:* Index of ADRs, design artefacts, and key implementation patterns
  - *Format:* Markdown index with search-friendly organization
  - *Integration:* Link from main documentation and README

### 4. Future Improvements Management
- [ ] **4.1 Improvement Extraction**: Extract future improvement notes from completed tasks
  - *Scope:* Performance optimizations, architectural enhancements, feature extensions
  - *Sources:* T027 flotsam improvements, T028 repository enhancements, etc.
  - *Deliverable:* Categorized list of improvements with context and priority
- [ ] **4.2 Backlog Item Creation**: Create properly scoped backlog items for significant improvements
  - *Scope:* Convert improvement notes into actionable task cards
  - *Format:* Follow kanban task card format with proper context and acceptance criteria
  - *Prioritization:* Technical debt vs new features vs performance optimizations
- [ ] **4.3 Improvement Roadmap**: Organize improvements into logical implementation sequences
  - *Scope:* Group related improvements, identify dependencies, suggest implementation order
  - *Format:* Roadmap document with phases and rationale
  - *Integration:* Link to project planning and architectural evolution

## Notes / Discussion Log

### **Task Creation (2025-07-18 - AI)**

**Extraction from T027:**
- Originally T027 Phase 2.3.1 (anchor comments), but recognized as broader knowledge management need
- Applies to entire codebase, not just flotsam implementation
- Opportunity to extract valuable insights from completed work

**Broader Scope Recognition:**
- **Documentation Debt**: Multiple completed tasks likely contain valuable insights not yet formalized
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Current documentation may not be easily discoverable
- **Pattern Recognition**: Opportunities to identify and document reusable patterns
- **Future Planning**: Improvement notes scattered across task cards need organization

**Key Insights from T027:**
- T027 implementation notes contain extensive architectural insights
- Multiple ADRs created during flotsam development demonstrate pattern
- Design artefacts embedded in task cards could be extracted and formalized
- Future improvements section shows pattern for capturing enhancement opportunities

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Systematic Review**: Audit all task cards for knowledge extraction opportunities
- **Incremental Implementation**: Start with highest-value extractions (ADRs, anchor comments)
- **Tool Support**: Consider automation opportunities for knowledge management
- **Process Integration**: Embed knowledge capture in future task workflows

**Expected Benefits:**
- Improved code maintainability through better documentation linkage
- Preserved institutional knowledge from completed work
- More discoverable documentation and design decisions
- Better future planning through organized improvement tracking
- Enhanced developer onboarding through comprehensive knowledge base

**Success Metrics:**
- Number of ADRs created from task card extraction
- Code coverage of anchor comments linking to documentation
- Reduction in time to find relevant architectural context
- Quality of future improvement backlog organization
