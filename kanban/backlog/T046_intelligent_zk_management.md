# Intelligent ZK Installation & Configuration Management

**Context (Background)**:
Enhance user experience with intelligent ZK dependency management, automated installation guidance, and comprehensive configuration validation. This task addresses the gap between simple runtime detection (T041) and production-ready ZK integration.

**Type**: `feature` + `user-experience`

**Overall Status:** `Backlog`

## Reference (Relevant Files / URLs)

### Implementation Areas
- `internal/zk/` - ZK tool abstraction and management
- `cmd/doctor.go` - Dependency checking and health validation
- `internal/config/` - Configuration management integration
- `doc/specifications/flotsam.md` - Tool abstraction specification

### External Dependencies
- [ZK Installation Guide](https://github.com/zk-org/zk) - Official installation methods
- [go-command-chain](https://github.com/rainu/go-command-chain) - Command pipeline library
- Platform package managers (brew, apt, pacman, etc.)

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Interactive installation wizard for first-time setup
- [ ] Clear error messages with actionable remediation steps
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running validation operations
- [ ] Integration with vice onboarding flow
- [ ] Documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Technical Design Notes

### Architecture Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Tool management through ViceEnv configuration
- **Strategy Pattern**: Platform-specific installation strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: Configuration change monitoring and validation
- **Command Pattern**: Installation and configuration operations

### Configuration Schema
```toml
# .zk/config.toml with vice extensions
[notebook]
dir = "."
format = "markdown"

[note]
filename = "{{id}}"
extension = "md"
template = "default.md"
id-charset = "alphanum"
id-length = 4
id-case = "lower"

[vice]
# Vice-specific extensions
srs-enabled = true
tag-prefix = "vice:"
cache-strategy = "mtime"
```

### Validation Strategy
- **Syntax Validation**: TOML parsing and structure checking
- **Semantic Validation**: Vice compatibility and feature requirements
- **Performance Validation**: Large notebook handling and operation timing
- **Integration Validation**: SRS database and tag system compatibility

## Roadblocks

*(No roadblocks identified yet)*

## Future Improvements & Refactoring Opportunities

### **Advanced Features**
1. **Automatic Updates**: ZK version monitoring and upgrade suggestions
2. **Performance Optimization**: ZK configuration tuning for large notebooks
3. **Multi-Notebook Support**: Managing multiple zk notebooks with vice
4. **Cloud Sync Integration**: Validation for cloud-synced zk notebooks

### **Platform Extensions**
1. **Package Manager Integration**: Direct installation through platform managers
2. **Container Support**: Docker/Podman integration for isolated zk environments
3. **IDE Integration**: VS Code/Vim extensions for zk + vice workflows
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and validation in build pipelines

## Notes / Discussion Log

### **Task Creation (2025-07-19 - AI)**

**Motivation**: T041 established basic zk runtime detection, but production usage requires more sophisticated installation guidance and configuration management. Users need clear paths from "I want flotsam features" to "fully working zk integration."

**Scope Boundaries**: This task focuses on user experience and operational reliability, not core flotsam functionality. It builds on T041's foundation to provide production-ready zk integration.

**Design Philosophy**: 
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without this, enhanced UX with it
- **Opinionated Defaults**: Provide good defaults while preserving user flexibility
- **Clear Error Messages**: Every failure should include clear remediation steps
- **Platform Awareness**: Respect platform conventions and package management practices

**Integration Points**: Extends `vice doctor`, enhances error handling throughout flotsam commands, integrates with vice onboarding and configuration systems.
