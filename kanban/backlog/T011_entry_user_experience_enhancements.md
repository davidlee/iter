# Entry User Experience Enhancements

**Context (Background)**:
- T010: Complete entry system with goal collection flows and scoring integration
- Core entry functionality complete with field-type aware data collection
- All goal types (Simple, Elastic, Informational, Checklist) fully implemented
- Scoring engine integration complete with real-time feedback

**Context (Significant Code Files)**:
- internal/ui/entry.go - Main entry collector with complete flow integration (T010/4.1 complete)
- internal/ui/entry/goal_collection_flows.go - Complete goal collection flow implementations
- internal/ui/entry/flow_implementations.go - All goal type flow methods with scoring and feedback
- internal/ui/entry/flow_factory.go - Factory for creating appropriate goal flows
- internal/models/entry.go - Entry data structures (DayEntry, GoalEntry, AchievementLevel)

## 1. Goal / User Story

As a user, I want an enhanced entry collection experience with clear progress indication, flexible session navigation, and comprehensive feedback to make daily habit tracking efficient and motivating.

**Current State Assessment:**
Based on T010's complete entry system implementation:

- ‚úÖ **Complete Goal Collection**: All goal types with field-type aware data collection
- ‚úÖ **Scoring Integration**: Real-time automatic scoring with immediate feedback
- ‚úÖ **Achievement Display**: Visual feedback for all goal types with styled indicators
- ‚úÖ **Field Input Components**: Complete bubbletea + huh integration for all field types
- ‚ùå **Progress Indication**: No current goal position display (e.g., "Goal 3 of 7")
- ‚ùå **Session Navigation**: No ability to skip goals, edit previous entries, or review within session
- ‚ùå **Enhanced Styling**: Basic completion summary lacks detailed achievement overview
- ‚ùå **Flow Control**: No session-level navigation or goal ordering controls

**User Story:**
I want an entry system that:
- **Progress Awareness**: Clear indication of current position in goal collection session

# Architecture

## System Overview

The entry user experience enhancements build upon T010's complete goal collection system, adding session-level navigation and progress tracking without modifying the core collection flows.

## Enhanced Entry Flow Architecture

## Session Navigation Components

![Session Navigation Flow](/doc/diagrams/session_navigation_flow.svg)

## Session State Management

The enhanced UX introduces session-level state management while preserving the existing goal collection flows:

| Component | Responsibility | Integration Point |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| `SessionNavigator` | Navigation control and flow management | Wraps existing `EntryCollector` |
| `ProgressTracker` | Current position and completion tracking | Integrates with goal collection flows |
| `SessionState` | State persistence and recovery | Works with existing entry storage |
| `NavigationStack` | Back/forward navigation history | Tracks goal collection sequence |

## Progress Indication System

The progress system provides real-time feedback on session completion:

```
Goal 3 of 7: Exercise Tracking (Elastic Goal)
Progress: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 42% Complete
Achievements: 2 Simple ‚úì, 1 Elastic ‚≠ê‚≠ê, 0 Informational üìä
```

## Integration with Existing T010 System

### Preserved Components (No Changes)
- Goal collection flows (Simple, Elastic, Informational, Checklist)
- Field input components and validation
- Scoring engine integration and feedback display
- Achievement calculation and visual styling
- Entry data models and storage

### Enhanced Components (Extensions)
- `EntryCollector` wrapped with session navigation
- Progress display added to collection loop
- Navigation controls integrated with existing flows
- Session summary enhanced with detailed breakdown

### New Components (Additions)
- `SessionNavigator` - Navigation control wrapper
- `ProgressTracker` - Progress indication and statistics
- `SessionState` - State management and persistence
- `NavigationStack` - Navigation history and flow control

## Design Principles

- **Non-Disruptive**: Enhance existing T010 system without breaking changes
- **Flow Preservation**: Maintain goal collection flow integrity and behavior
- **User Control**: Provide flexible navigation without forcing linear progression
- **Progress Transparency**: Clear indication of session state and completion
- **Recovery Support**: Handle interrupted sessions and resume functionality
