# Entry UI Architecture Refactoring and Enhancement Planning

**Context (Background)**:
T018 identified extensive future improvements and refactoring opportunities across the entry system. This planning task will analyze all architectural debt, prioritize improvements, and create a comprehensive implementation roadmap that sequences refactoring work before UI enhancements.

**Context (Significant Code Files)**:
- `internal/ui/entrymenu/` - Complete entry menu system with identified refactoring needs
- `internal/ui/entry/` - Core entry collection flows and field inputs  
- `internal/ui/checklist/` - Checklist completion system (T007 considerations)
- Entry system architecture spanning multiple UI components
- Related task analysis from T011, T007 Phase 5.3, T012, T016
