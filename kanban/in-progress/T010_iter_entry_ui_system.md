# Iter Entry: Goal Data Collection UI System

**Context (Background)**:
- CLAUDE.md (CLI patterns, bubbletea + huh framework usage)
- doc/workflow.md (task workflow, stopping conditions)
- doc/specifications/goal_schema.md (complete goal type and field type specifications)
- T009: Goal Management UI Redux (comprehensive goal configuration system)
- T005: Goal Configuration UI (foundation patterns)
- T007: Dynamic Checklist System (checklist goal support)

**Context (Significant Code Files)**:
- internal/ui/entry.go - Current entry collection system (basic implementation, 250+ lines)
- internal/ui/*_handler.go - Goal type-specific entry handlers (elastic_handler.go, informational_handler.go, etc.)
- internal/ui/goalconfig/ - Complete goal configuration system (patterns for field type handling)
- internal/models/goal.go - Goal and field type data models (SimpleGoal, ElasticGoal, InformationalGoal, ChecklistGoal)
- internal/models/entry.go - Entry data structures (DayEntry, GoalEntry, AchievementLevel)
- internal/scoring/ - Scoring engine for automatic goal evaluation
- internal/storage/ - Entry persistence system

## 1. Goal / User Story

As a user, I want to efficiently record daily habit entries through an intuitive CLI interface that adapts to each goal's type and field configuration, providing immediate feedback and automatic scoring where applicable.

**Current State Assessment:**
Based on T009's comprehensive goal configuration system and existing entry.go implementation:

- ✅ **Goal Loading**: Goals loaded from YAML schema with all goal types supported
- ✅ **Basic Entry Flow**: Skeleton entry collection loop exists for all goals
- ✅ **Storage Integration**: EntryStorage handles persistence to entries file
- ✅ **Scoring Integration**: ScoringEngine available for automatic evaluation
- ❌ **Field Type Adaptation**: Entry UI doesn't adapt to different field types (Boolean, Text, Numeric, Time, Duration, Checklist)
- ❌ **Goal Type Handling**: No specialized UI for Simple vs Elastic vs Informational vs Checklist goals
- ❌ **Automatic Scoring**: Scoring engine not integrated with entry collection
- ❌ **Achievement Feedback**: No immediate feedback for elastic goal achievement levels
- ❌ **Data Validation**: No field-level validation during entry
- ❌ **Interactive Experience**: Basic placeholder implementation lacks bubbletea + huh patterns

**User Story:**
I want an entry system that:
- **Adapts to Goal Types**: Different interaction patterns for Simple (pass/fail), Elastic (mini/midi/maxi), Informational (data-only), and Checklist goals
- **Field Type Awareness**: Appropriate input widgets for Boolean, Text, Numeric, Time, Duration, and Checklist fields
- **Immediate Scoring**: Automatic evaluation with instant feedback for goals with criteria
- **Data Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear indication of completion status and achievement levels
- **Efficient Flow**: Streamlined experience following established CLI patterns from T009/T005

# Architecture

## System Overview

The `iter entry` system provides field-type-aware data collection for all goal types with immediate scoring feedback. Built on the foundation established by T009's goal configuration system, it reuses proven bubbletea + huh patterns while integrating seamlessly with the existing scoring engine.

## Field Type to Input Widget Mapping

| Field Type | Huh Widget | Key Features | Validation |
|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Boolean | `huh.NewConfirm()` | Yes/No confirmation | Built-in boolean validation |
| Text (single) | `huh.NewInput()` | Standard text input | Required/optional validation |
| Text (multi) | `huh.NewText()` | Multi-line text area | Length limits, newline support |
| Numeric (all) | `huh.NewInput()` | Number input with unit display | Type validation + min/max constraints |
| Time | `huh.NewInput()` | HH:MM format | Time format validation (00:00-23:59) |
| Duration | `huh.NewInput()` | Flexible duration parsing | Duration format validation (1h 30m, 45m) |
| Checklist | `huh.NewMultiSelect()` | Multi-select interface | Completion state tracking |

## Scoring Integration Architecture

The scoring integration provides immediate feedback during entry collection. For automatic scoring goals, the system evaluates user input against defined criteria and displays achievement levels (Mini/Midi/Maxi for elastic goals, Pass/Fail for simple goals) in real-time. Manual scoring goals collect data without evaluation, allowing subjective assessment by the user.

## Existing Foundation Integration

### Reusable Components from T009/T005
- **FieldValueInputFactory** (`internal/ui/goalconfig/field_value_input.go`) - Complete field input component system
- **Bubbletea + Huh Patterns** - Established in SimpleGoalCreator and ElasticGoalCreator
- **Validation Framework** - Type-specific validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Scoring Engine** (`internal/scoring/engine.go`) - Ready for integration with immediate feedback

### Entry System Foundation
- **EntryCollector** (`internal/ui/entry.go`) - Basic structure with proper dependencies
- **Handler Pattern** (`internal/ui/handlers.go`) - Goal-type-specific entry collection interface
- **Data Models** - Complete entry persistence with `models.DayEntry` and `models.GoalEntry`

### Integration Points
1. **Field Input Factory**: Direct reuse of existing `FieldValueInputFactory` for input widget creation
2. **Goal Type Handlers**: Extend existing handler pattern with bubbletea integration
3. **Scoring Integration**: Connect existing `scoring.Engine` for immediate achievement feedback
4. **Data Persistence**: Leverage existing `storage.EntryStorage` for entry saving/loading

## Design Principles

- **Component Reuse**: Leverage proven patterns from T009 goal configuration system
- **Field Type Awareness**: Adaptive UI based on field type configuration
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time scoring and achievement display for automatic goals
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established bubbletea + huh conventions
- **Testing Strategy**: Headless testing approach similar to goal configuration system
