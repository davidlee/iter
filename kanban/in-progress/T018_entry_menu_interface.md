# Entry Menu Interface

**Context (Background)**:
Entry menu interface provides streamlined daily habit tracking by combining goal browsing with direct entry capabilities. Current system requires separate `vice goal list` and `vice entry` commands. This task creates unified interface showing goals with visual status indicators and allowing immediate entry without command switching.

**Context (Significant Code Files)**:
- `cmd/entry.go` - Entry command with --menu flag integration (MODIFIED)
- `cmd/root.go` - Root command configuration for default behavior  
- `internal/ui/entry.go` - EntryCollector orchestrates entry workflow
- `internal/ui/entrymenu/model.go` - Complete BubbleTea model with navigation (NEW)
- `internal/ui/entrymenu/view.go` - ViewRenderer for progress bar and layout (NEW)
- `internal/ui/entrymenu/navigation.go` - NavigationHelper and smart navigation (NEW)
- `internal/ui/goalconfig/goal_list.go` - GoalListModel provides goal browsing patterns
- `internal/ui/entry/goal_collection_flows.go` - Goal-specific entry collection flows
- `internal/ui/entry/` - Field input components and entry UI patterns

- `b1d409e` - feat(kanban)[T018]: add entry menu interface task

## 1. Goal / User Story

As a user, I want a streamlined entry interface that shows all my goals with their current status and allows me to enter values one by one, so that I can efficiently complete my daily habit tracking without navigating multiple commands.

This interface should become the primary entry point for the application, making daily use frictionless and visually informative.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `vice entry --menu` flag launches interactive goal selection interface
- [ ] Interface displays goals similar to `vice goal list` but optimized for entry
- [ ] Goals show color-coded status indicators (success/failed/skipped/incomplete)
- [ ] Completion progress bar shows overall daily progress
- [ ] Selecting a goal launches entry interface for that specific goal
- [ ] entries.yml is written after each goal entry
- [ ] Next incomplete goal is auto-selected upon return to menu
- [ ] Interface provides clear navigation controls (exit, skip, etc.)
- [ ] `vice` (no arguments) defaults to entry menu interface
- [ ] All existing entry functionality remains available through existing commands

## 3. Architecture

### Design Strategy: Loose Coupling Through Existing Interfaces

**Interface Reuse Pattern**: Entry menu will leverage existing abstractions (`EntryCollector`, `GoalCollectionFlow`) rather than direct goal type coupling, supporting T017's loose coupling goals.

**Color System Integration**: Will use lipgloss with termenv for cross-platform color support:
- Success: `lipgloss.Color("214")` (gold)
- Failed: `lipgloss.Color("88")` (dark red)  
- Skipped: `lipgloss.Color("240")` (dark grey)
- Incomplete: `lipgloss.Color("250")` (light grey)

**Component Architecture**:
```
EntryMenuModel (BubbleTea UI)
├── EntryCollector (existing orchestration)
├── GoalCollectionFlow (existing entry flows)
├── GoalListModel patterns (navigation/display)
└── MenuState (progress tracking, filters)
```

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **Abstraction Layer**: Menu interacts with `EntryCollector` interface, not specific goal types
- **State Management**: Separate menu state from entry collection state for clean separation
- **Navigation Flow**: Bidirectional flow between menu and entry with configurable return behavior
- **Extensibility**: Design supports T017's planned multi-field goals and validation flexibility

  - **WORKING SOFTWARE**: `vice entry --menu` now launches functional UI
  
**Major UI improvements during implementation**:
- **Status emojis replaced goal type emojis**: ✓(completed), ✗(failed), ~(skipped), ☐(incomplete)
- **Layout improvements**: "Return: menu" right-aligned with progress bar when space allows
- **Visual progress bar**: Restored full progress bar with statistics and visual indicator
- **Real data integration**: Loads actual goals.yml and entries.yml files

**Current functional state**: 
- ✅ Full menu navigation with real data
- ✅ Progress tracking and visual feedback  
- ✅ All filtering and keybinding functionality
- ❌ Entry collection (pressing Enter exits - needs Phase 3.1)

**Next critical step**: Phase 3.1 (entry integration) to make goal selection functional

- `2025-07-14 - AI:` Layout issues resolved: Return behavior moved to footer for robust layout
  - **FIXED**: Tests failing due to brittle layout logic - now all tests passing

**Current functional state**: 
- ✅ Full menu navigation with real data
- ✅ Progress tracking and visual feedback  
- ✅ All filtering and keybinding functionality
- ✅ Clean, robust layout with proper visual hierarchy
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (all tests passing)
- ❌ Entry collection (pressing Enter exits - needs Phase 3.1)

**Next critical step**: Phase 3.1 (entry integration) to make goal selection functional

**Testing Framework Evaluation - COMPLETED** (2025-07-14):
- **teatest POC SUCCESSFUL**: Two integration tests implemented and passing
- **Key findings**: 
  - ✅ 80x slower than unit tests (250ms vs 3ms) but fills critical integration gap
  - ✅ Excellent for complex user flows: navigation → selection → state changes
  - ✅ Golden file testing effective for UI regression prevention  
  - ✅ Clean API for user input simulation and output capture
- **ROI Assessment**: HIGH VALUE for Phase 3.1+ complex multi-step flows
- **Adoption Strategy**: Keep unit tests + add teatest for integration flows
- **Investment realized**: ~2 hours setup (complete), teatest ready for Phase 3.1

**Future improvements identified**:
- Goal type indication: Need alternative way to show goal types (simple/elastic/informational) 
- Entry collection integration: Phase 3.1 should reuse existing EntryCollector methods
- Default command: Phase 4.2 to make `vice` alone launch menu (zero additional work)

**Refactoring advisable**:
- Consider extracting emoji constants to shared package for consistency
- ViewRenderer could benefit from more configurable styling options
